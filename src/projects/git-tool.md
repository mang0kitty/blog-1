# Git Tool
**Simplify checking out your Git repositories in a structured directory space**

Git Tool is a powerful tool for managing your Git repositories, storing them in
a consistent folder structure and simplifying access when you need it. One of
its biggest advantages is that you no longer need to think about where your
development directory is on different devices. Just `gt o my-repo` and you're
ready to start developing, even if the code wasn't already cloned.

## Features

- **Quickly open repositories** whether they are already cloned locally or not, using your favourite Git services and a concise folder structure.
- **Launch applications** within the context of your repositories quickly and consistently.
- **Weekly scratchpads** to help organize random work and doodles with minimal effort.
- **Aliases** to make opening your most common repositories as quick as possible.
- **Fast autocompletion** on all platforms with support for "sequence search" (`ssgt` matches `SierraSoftworks/git-tool`) as found in Sublime and VSCode.
