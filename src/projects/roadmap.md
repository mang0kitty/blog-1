This project is designed to make visualizing and tweaking your road maps as easy and straightforward as possible. There are a number of good options out there, including PowerPoint, Visio, LucidChart, Draw.io, GraphViz and just plain old lists - however none of them have made me particularly excited about drawing up our team's road maps and many of them make future edits difficult.

The goal here is to change that, by defining your road map in everyone's least loved markup language: YAML. An example road map might look something like the following.
