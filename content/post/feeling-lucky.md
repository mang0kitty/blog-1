Anybody who has worked in the development world for a significant portion of
time will have built up a vast repertoire of abbreviations to describe how
they solve problems. Everything from TDD to DDD and, my favourites, [FDD](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FearDrivenDevelopmentFDD.aspx)
and [HDD](http://hopedrivendevelopment.blogspot.ie/). There are so many in fact that you'll find a
[website dedicated to naming and shaming them](http://devdriven.by).

I'm not one to add another standard to the mix... Oh who am I kidding, let me
introduce you to Chance Driven Development.

## Chance Driven Development

Chance Driven Development is a revolutionary new approach to developing software
in which we trust that the universe will solve our problems for us. Well, the universe
and the wealth of code available already.

CDD is built on the solid foundation of statistical probability, which states that
if we have the components to build a functional system and attempt a sufficient
number of combinations we will eventually build that functional system.

## The Fate/Chance Argument

Chance Driven Development has seen some rather violent opposition in the form of the
Fate Driven Development camp, who believe that there is no such thing as true chance
and that the fate of all software is predetermined by the Pseudo-Random gods (and the
[NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency)).

As an avid Change Driven Development advocate myself, the concept that the way my
programs function may be predetermined, or their output predicted, is absolute
heresy to me. As such, someone who suggests otherwise will promptly be glared at...

## Benefits

The benefits of CDD are just beginning to be realized, but tools like `[npm](https://www.npmjs.com)`
are making it possible to import absolutely massive quantities of code with almost
no effort. When you combine this with our CDD libraries, it becomes almost a
statistical impossibility that you cannot be successful.

In addition to this, Chance Driven Development methodologies parallellise exceptionally,
making them ever more attractive as the number of processor cores available to us
increases.

## Implementations

To get you started with CDD, we've thrown together a library in a popular statically
typed language - C#. We figured releasing one on a dynamic language was too dangerous
after what happened to #zadevelopers. You can find its source code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/SierraSoftworks/feeling-lucky-csharp).

## Origins

Chance Driven Development was stumbled upon by chance during a coding challenge,
in which a developer wished to showcase how flexible dynamic languages were by
randomly executing a method on any object presented to it.

The genius of this idea was soon noticed when his snippet of code became sentient
and took control of the Slack group it had been posted in. The community was later
tricked into relocating by this sentience, a moment we shall never forget.

We accept absolutely no responsibility for anything your pseudo-random number
generator may have your software do. If things go wrong, please raise your concerns

favour.
